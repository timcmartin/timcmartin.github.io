# Apple Fritter Bread

## Ingredients

### Bread

- 2 large crisp, firm apples
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 2 heaping teaspoons ground cinnamon
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil
- 1/4 cup sour cream
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

### Glaze

- 1/2 cup sifted confectioners sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 4 teaspoons milk

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Generously butter an 8x4-inch loaf pan, and line with parchment.
2. Core the apples, and cut into approximately 1/4-inch cubes. The apples do not need to be peeled. Transfer into a mixing bowl and add brown sugar, cinnamon, and ginger. Toss with a spatula until thoroughly combined. Let stand for 5 to 10 minutes to macerate.
3. Add flour, salt, and baking soda to a small bowl and whisk until evenly combined. Set aside.
4. Combine egg, white sugar, vegetable oil, sour cream, and vanilla in a bowl. Whisk until everything is thoroughly combined, about 1 minute. Use a spatula to toss the apple mixture, and then transfer about 75% of it into the egg-sugar mixture. Stir to combine evenly. Add flour mixture; stir gently with a spatula just until flour disappears.
5. Transfer the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Tap the pan a few times on the counter to settle the batter. Spoon remaining apple mixture evenly over the top.
6. Bake in the upper center of the preheated oven until a bamboo skewer comes out clean, 55 to 60 minutes. If using an instant-read thermometer, the internal temperature at the center should read 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).
7. Remove from the oven, and let cool for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the pan to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.
8. Meanwhile, for glaze, whisk confectioner’s sugar, vanilla, and milk together until smooth; set aside.
9. Drizzle icing over cooled bread. Let the loaf sit until icing firms up. Serve immediately, or refrigerate to serve later.
