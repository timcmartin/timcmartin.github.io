> I wanted to try some sourdough bagels and decided to convert Babish & Dan's
> recipe to use starter instead of yeast. Turned out pretty good!

## Notes

- 2 tsp yeast = 100 g of starter
- subtract 50g of flour and 50g of water
- My current starter method worked pretty well for this amount.
  Taking 100 g left enough to do a 50 g refresh of what remained.
- I took the starter out of the refrigerator in the evening and left on
  heater overnight.

## Ingredients

- 100 g of active sourdough starter
- 205 g of water
- 2 Tbs Honey
- 366 g of bread flour
- 4 tsp vital wheat gluten
- 1/4 tsp diastatic malt powder
- 2 tsp of salt
- 1/4 cup cornmeal
- 1/4 cup topping

### Boiling Liquid

- 1 Tbs baking soda
- 3 Tbs honey

## Directions

1. Mix water, honey and starter together in a bowl.
2. In the food processor, mix flour, vital wheat gluten, diastatic malt powder.
3. Add the wet ingredients until dough comes together. Let rest for 10 minutes.
4. Add salt and process for 90 seconds.
5. Knead for a few minutes by hand until smooth and divide into 117 gram balls.
6. Let rest for 15 minutes.
7. Roll into bagels, with a twist and place on a sheet pan dusted with cornmeal.
8. Let rest at room temperature for 1 hour, and then place in the fridge overnight.
9. Preheat oven to 450 degrees, and bring a dutch oven of water to a boil with
   1 Tbs of baking soda and 3 Tbs of honey.
10. Boil the bagels 3 at a time for 20 - 30 seconds each side. Place on a wire
    rack in a rimmed baking sheet.
11. Top with desired topping.
12. Pour 1/2 cup of the boiling liquid into the sheet pan and bake for 20 - 25
    minutes, flipping halfway.
