> NOTE: Try cutting this in half and using a quarter sheet pan for a smaller batch.

## Ingredients

- 3 cups (15 ounces) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 cup (1 3/4 ounces) sugar
- 4 teaspoons baking powder
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt
- 3 large eggs
- 6 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 1/4 cups milk
- 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Spray
   bottom and sides of rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray.
2. Whisk 3 cups all-purpose flour, ¼ cup sugar, 4 teaspoons baking powder,
   ¾ teaspoon baking soda, and 1½ teaspoons table salt together in large bowl.
   Whisk 3 large eggs and 6 tablespoons vegetable oil in second medium bowl until
   well combined, then whisk 2¼ cups milk and ¾ teaspoon vanilla extract into egg
   mixture. Add egg mixture to flour mixture and stir gently until just combined
   (batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour). Let batter sit for 10
   minutes before cooking.
3. Using rubber spatula, transfer batter to prepared pan and spread into even
   layer, being sure to spread into corners as well. Bake until pancake is spotty
   brown and firm to touch, about 20 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through
   baking. Transfer to wire rack and let cool for 3 to 5 minutes. Serve with salted
   butter and maple syrup.
