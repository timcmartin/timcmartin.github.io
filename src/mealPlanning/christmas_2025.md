# Christmas 2025

## Dinner Notes

- Pulled 6 litres of stock from the freezer - used 2 for gravy, 1/2 for stuffing.

- [Deconstructed Turkey](src/mains/deconstructed_turkey.md):
  - Froze carcass for later, used giblets and trim for [gravy](src/condiments/turkey_gravy.md#CIGravy).
  - Dry Brined 24 hours.
  - Roasted alone in the oven at 350 for 1.75 hours.
  - Used a half sheet pan lined with foil and a rack.
  - Turned out well.

- [Buns](src/sides/buns.md):
  - Used muffin tin - still a little big but turned out well.
  - Tried to bake with the turkey in - bottoms were cooked but no colour.

- Mashed Potatoes:
  - Ricer and boursin - good. Needed more cream.
- Brussels Sprouts
- Roast beets

## Baking Notes

- [Mince tarts](src/desserts/mincemeat.md):
  - good amount - one batch, used medium scoop, filled 21 shells.

- Nuts and Bolts:
  - Mostly Anna Olson's.
  - Same proportions.
  - chex, crispix and cheerios, goldfish, cheese nips, cheese-its, pretzels,
    peanuts and pork rinds.
  - Used Frank's powder in it along with other stuff listed in Anna's.

- Shortbread cookies:
  - Used [this](src/desserts/shortbread_cutout.md).
  - Not quite right - I think try another one next year with corn starch.

- Haystacks:
  - butterscotch chips & chocolate chips
